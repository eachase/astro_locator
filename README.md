The goal of this project is to determine the latitude and longitude of a postition on Earth (within a few degrees) corresponding to the place where an astronomical event at a given right ascension (ra) and declination (dec) would have occurred immediately overhead at a given time

# Input
- Time of observation (UTC)
- Right ascension
- Declination

# Output
- Latitude
- Longitude

# Assumptions
- ...
- test
